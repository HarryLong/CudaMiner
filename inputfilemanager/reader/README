The input file reader serves as a parser for the input bianry data. It can be compiled in one of two ways:

  1. As a standalone application which parses the output and writes the content to another file or standard output --> CMakeListsExec.txt

  1. As a library to be used by another application for parsing input files --> CMakeListsLib.txt

In order to compile the version needed, creaty a symbolic link names CMakeLists.txt to one of the two CMake files above, then run CMake as per usual.
